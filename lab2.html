         <p>At some point in most 3D projects, you’ll need to turn your model into a drawing set that gets the point across. LayOut in SketchUp Pro lets you add model views to pages, choose drawing scales, adjust line weights, and add dimensions, callouts, and graphics. Make a change to your SketchUp model, and find it reflected automatically in LayOut. And when it’s time, export pages as PDFs, images and CAD files.</p>

            <p>Consider following along with a SketchUp model of your own (or by downloading one from the 3D Warehouse that might lend itself to some section animation action). You'll want to make sure your project is set up with Scenes and Layers similar to how I start this video. Note: this is a more advanced technique, so don't get frustrated if it takes you a few tries to get things right! If you’d like to follow along with the same .SKP file that I use in the video, you can download it from the 3D Warehouse. This model was originally created by the International Masonry Institute; I just moved geometry to different Layers and made some new Scenes.</p>

            <p>I have seen this question multiple times in the forums: how do I draw a screw in SketchUp? I’m not always sure why, but the question keeps surfacing.Often times the solution is simple: just download a screw from 3D Warehouse (there are literally thousands of them). If you MUST draw a screw from scratch, then the quickest solution is probably to grab an extension from Extension Warehouse (like EP Fasteners or Draw Wohrl). However, my inner-trainer has a problem with this solution. “No!,” inner-trainer yells. “Teach them! Teach them the ways of the screw! Give a 3D modeler a screw, and you have helped them with a single model. Teach a 3D modeler to draw a threaded rod, and you have given them new Sketchup skills.”</p>

               It's simple enough to change the color of a face in SketchUp, right? All you have to do is click the Paint Bucket tool, choose the color that you want to use, and then click to paint the face. Simple!
